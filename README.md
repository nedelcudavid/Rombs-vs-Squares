### General Description
I developed a 2D tower-defense style game, similar to Plants vs Zombies, using OpenGL
and the GFX Framework, featuring real-time rendering, drag-and-drop interaction,
and resource management mechanics.

In order to run the code you will need the GFX Framework. Just add the files in a folder named "Tema 1" and add it in the src -> lab_m1 of the framework.
GFX Framework: https://github.com/UPB-Graphics/gfx-framework
